Online Restaurant Order Project Summary:

1. This project realizes the table bookings online

2. This project is FullStack(MEAN), install and run mongodb/nodejs properly , also install 
   the relied modules like express, mongojs, mongodb and get familiar with the website to  
   check and use them.

3. Final2 : we suppose the users are near by the owner’s location

4. Improvement 1 : auto sign. we could assign the restaurants’ info first when there are some restaurants we find (using yelp or google) and store them into the ‘/restaurant’.
Then, do some functions if there are some users in the table(established the ‘/booking’ for only the ones have ordered the table ,and ‘/table’ for those don’t), and if ‘/table’
is not null, assign the restaurants to the table from the first to the last one by one.

5. Improvement 2: find the method for the small screen when we click the CustomerId.

6. Improvement 3: Cleaning the code and make clairfied collections for the mongodb.
